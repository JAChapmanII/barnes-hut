This is a brief implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm, as it would need to
be implmented if I were in Analysis of Algorithms. Meant to give me experience
for when I try to do something similar (unless this works out to be what I was
thinking the fast multipole method was) in Universum Meum.

Compile:
	make

Run:
	./bin/barnes-hut [filename]
	If you do not specify a file containing the initial particle descriptions,
	this program will prompt you to spceify the file on stdin.

Warning:
	I haven't done much file IO, so don't run this on something you don't want to
	turn into a radioactive sheep-cheese.

License:
	GPL3, see COPYING

Notes:
	It's flawed right now. Very subtly flawed. Or, I haven't looked at it enough.
	Right now thoug, it produces data that is .12% to 5% off of a reference
	implementation. Grrr. It helps that I don't know the proper handling method
	for zero-mass trees.
