This is a brief implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm, as it would need to
be implmented if I were in Analysis of Algorithms. Meant to give me experience
for when I try to do something similar (unless this works out to be what I was
thinking the fast multipole method was) in Universum Meum.

Compile:
	make

Run:
	./bin/barnes-hut [filename] [tau]
	If you do not specify a file containing the initial particle descriptions,
	this program will prompt you to spceify the file on stdin. If you do not
	specify a tau value, 0.5 will be assumed.

Input/output format:
	Input format should be a series of lines with three floats on each line. The
	first float will be used as the x, the next y, and the final will be mass.
	Technically, white space doesn't matter but it looks better ;)

	The output will be the same as the input, except on each line the
	instantaneous x and y accelerations will be appended

Warning:
	I haven't done much file IO, so don't run this on something you don't want to
	turn into a radioactive sheep-cheese. (it has been tested repeatedly, and it
	hasn't done this up to this point, still, don't run it on anything not in the
	right format)

License:
	GPL3, see COPYING

Notes:
	Pay attention to compiler warnings about using == and != on floating point
	values if you ever make something like this!
