Running this for a long time doing a test case uses an exorbitant amount of RAM.
Probably a memory leak somewhere in the testing code.

This thing is stupidly parallizable, get at least basic threading support down.

The method for handling test cases needs to be re-written just to save the error
and re-load partial error data. Saving each test case thrashes the HDD.
